<h3>Description</h3></p>
<p>French tacos are a street dish originally from Lyon, France, that combines international influences. 
Despite their name, they don't have much in common with Mexican tacos.
They are prepared by wrapping meat (such as chicken, beef or kebab), fries, cheese and sauces in a burrito-type 
wheat tortilla, which is then folded into a rectangular shape and heated on a griddle or press until golden and crispy.
 It is a fast and forceful meal, popular among students and young people, and is usually offered with a variety of 
 combinations and personalized sauces.</p>
